## Description
Meme-ories is a social media app that prompts users to come up with funny captions for memes! Users can interact with each other by “liking”/”laughing at” captions that they find funny! The goal is for users to try and get as many cumulative“likes”/”laughs” as they can on their creative captions. They can then make friend requests to compete against their friends on the leaderboard for the user that generates the most “laughs”/ “likes”.
